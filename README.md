# Array Stack Implementation

## 1. Project Description
This project enables the user to manually create and manipulate a stack. Furthermore, the project enables the user to have a deeper understanding of how a stack works without using Java's built in class.

## 2. Tech Stack/ Language
- Language: Java 
- IDE: Visual Studio Code

## 3. File Structure
- Main.java
- MyStack.java
- README.md

## 4. Features
- push(int value): Adds a value to the top of the stack.
- pop(): Returns the value the user wants to remove from the top of the stack.
- isEmpty(): Returns true if the stack is empty, false otherwise.
- isFull(): Returns true if the stack is full, false otherwise.
- peek(): Returns the value from the top of the stack.
- size(): Returns the size of the stack. 
- clear(): Clears what is inside of the stack.
- print(): Prints all elements inside of the stack from top to bottom.

## 5. How to Run
javac *.java
java Main

## 6. Time Complexity
- push(int value): O(1)
- pop(): O(1)
- isEmpty(): O(1)
- isFull(): O(1)
- peek(): O(1)
- size(): O(1) 
- clear(): O(1)
- print(): O(n)
